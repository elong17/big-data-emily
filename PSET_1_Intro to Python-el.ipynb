    "# Problem Set 1: Intro to Python\n",
    "This problem set is meant to create a good foundation of programming. We emphasize code readability and reusability over performance. Code performance can be measured in many different ways, and is by no means the focus of this course, however, we expect your code to be non-repetitive, clean, and efficient enough to deal with medium-to-large datasets. As we move forward with the course, you will be introduced to some functional programming techniques, iterators, and objects that will help speed-up the data munging of the type of data sets that we will be dealing with. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Throughout the course you will be using multiple online resources to help you solve the assignments, we do too. However, if you are using other people’s code, make sure to credit the source, and come up with your own implementation. In this problem set, you are welcome to refer to online resources and documentation. One of the primary ones you will find you use is:` [Stack Overflow]( http://stackoverflow.com/)."
